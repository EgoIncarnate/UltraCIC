Nintendo 64 CIC Clone
---------------------

UltraCIC is a clone of the Nintendo 64 copy protection chip, the CIC.
This code is meant to run on a PIC16F1613 microcontroller.

Note that the code omits the seed and checksum data which is necessary
to boot this code on a console. Adding this data is left as an exercise
to the reader.

History

This code was written by Mike Ryan as a part of the effort to reverse
engineer the Nintendo 64 CIC. The author would like to thank:

 - John McMaster (die shots)
 - Marshall H (ROM extraction)
 - Segher (too smart)
